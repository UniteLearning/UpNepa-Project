# UpNepa
A Power Management Application Project for Unite Learning 
This is a collaborative project for Unite Learning students class of March 2024.  

# About the project

Power supply is very erratic in lots of African countries including Nigeria. Because power companies do not provide any type of meaningful information regarding the variation in 
the supply of power within different neighborhoods, it is impossible to have any kind of data driven insight into how much power is stable or unstable between different 
neighborhoods. The goal of this project is to use survey to collect direct information from users across different neighborhoods during different times of the day. The survey participants were grouped into their respoective neighborhoods and asked to report on the status of their power supply three times a day (Morining, Aftrenoon, Night). The data is collected for 14 days (April 25 - March 9) and turned into a pandas dataframe that is assigned to a color coded geofence on a map interface; when a date and time of the day is selected, the color coded geofence displays the power status of the neighborhood (green for power on, red for power off).

# Contributions

Contributors are in the driving seat of a project like this so students can learn how to use programming to solve their own local problems. We need help with continous and contemporary data collection, better visualization for data comparison and expansion to more cities in Africa.  To add to this project, please fork the repo and create a pull request or simply open an issue with the tag "update". If you want to add this as a school project or if you have any other questions, please reach out to unite_learning@gmail.com  Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
